# 🚚 SABINA SUPPLIERS Transport Log

A real-world Streamlit app designed to solve a genuine business challenge — replacing pen-and-paper transport logs with a smart, searchable, and exportable digital system.

## 🧠 Why This App Exists

This project wasn’t born in a classroom or during a hackathon. It started when I visited my uncle’s friend, who runs a transport business in Hetauda, Nepal. I watched him manually record every truck, weight slip, and payment detail in a notebook — and then spend hours flipping through pages just to find one entry.

The problem wasn’t the data — it was the *lack of filtering, search, and export tools*. So I built this app for him.
